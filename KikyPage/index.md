Hey, I’m Arkhangelsky Daniil aka Kiky Tokamuro, a Software Engineer.

At work, I mainly specialize in **C**, **PHP**, **Golang**. But in my spare time, I like to work with **Lisp**, **Python**, and many others. Most of my non-work focus is in Programming Language theory, Operation System theory, and Developer tooling.

You can find all my projects and research on my [GitHub](https://github.com/KikyTokamuro).

If you have a position or project that you think might fit me, please send me an [Email](mailto:kiky.tokamuro@yandex.ru), or give my [[Curriculum Vitae]] to someone.

I also occasionally post interesting posts to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@kikytokamuro).

Outside of work and Open-Source, I like to work on my house, hangout with my wife, and read. I mostly read Novels and Fantasy books, but I’ll never say no to a good software or hardware book.
