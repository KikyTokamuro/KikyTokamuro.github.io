Once upon a time I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.lisperati.com/#!The_Official_Lisp_Alien_3D_Model">Lisp Alien 3D Model</a>, I thought I wanted the same one, but more elaborate and with more detail accuracy.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, the idea also remained somewhere in the depths of memory.
</p>

<p>
And recently, <a href="mailto:stanislove1199@gmail.com">my friend</a> told me that he began to get involved in 3D modeling. I thought this was my chance to bring my old idea to life.
We consulted with him a bit, discussed the details, as well as how the final model should look, and he agreed to take on this project.
</p>

<p>
During the implementation of the project, it was very interesting to watch how the model develops, new details appear in it, a soul appears.
From the very beginning, we wanted to make only an alien, and it will stop there.
</p>

<p>
But then we decided to add various new details to it:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the pedestal on which he will stand</li>
<li>flag</li>
<li>sword and shield</li>
<li>brain model inside an alien&#x2026; don't ask why&#x2026;</li>
<li>retro computer</li>
</ul>

<p>
It turned out funny with the computer model, we took the old Macintosh as a basis, and slightly changed its name to Nushtosh (Russian speakers will appreciate the joke):

A small cut of the moments of creation can be seen in this animation:

<p>
It was a very interesting and fun project, the result of which we were pleased with.
